	<h1>Welcome!</h1>
	<p>
		This site hosts automatically formatted rotation charts of the cards from <a href="https://lovelive-as-global.com/" target="_blank">Love Live SIF All Stars</a>. These charts can be useful for determining the girl that is the most likely to receive a card in the future, based on statistics such as how many cards are remaining in the current rotation and how long it has been since their last one.
	</p>
	<p>
		Of course the developers are not bound to rigid rotations, a fact most evident in event card rotations but also frequently seen in other categories of cards. Purpose of this site is to help make educated guesses.
	</p>
	<p>
		Card and event data is retrieved from <a href="https://allstars.kirara.ca/" target="_blank">Kirara All Stars Card Database</a>. Their data source is automatically scraped which does not guarantee data validity at all times so sometimes data on this site can also be incorrect or out of date as a result. A best effort is made and corrections will be made promptly.

		<h4>New Card History Page</h4>
