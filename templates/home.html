	<h1>Welcome!</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>
		The website hosts automatically created card rotation charts and statistics for the cards from <a href="https://lovelive-as-global.com/" target="_blank">Love Live SIF All Stars</a>, updated daily. These charts can help you figure out which girl is most likely to receive a card next based on statistics like how many cards are remaining in the current rotation and how long it's been since their last card.
	</p>
	<p>
		Of course keep in mind that the developers are bound by no rule when it comes to adding new content, something that is decidedly evident when it comes to events. The site can at most serve you to make educated guesses.
	</p>
	<p>
		Card and event data is retrieved from <a href="https://allstars.kirara.ca/" target="_blank">Kirara All Stars Card Database</a>. They automatically scrape new card and event data which can mean that sometimes the data on their site, and consequently this one, can be incorrect or out of date as a result. A best effort is made and corrections will be made promptly.
	</p>
	<p>
		Card release and event timestamps can be toggled between the original Japanese server releases and Global version dates, before acceleration ended. Check the "Use Global Dates" toggle in the settings.
	</p>
	<p>

			<h4>Global Dates and Other Updates!</h4>
			<div class="news-entry">
				<p>
					Now you can enable the site to use card release, event and banner dates from the global server too, alongside the original Japanese dates. Check the settings menu for "Global Dates" option. If you're on the desktop version it can be toggled by pressing the D-key as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, things are now unloaded on desktop version of the site whenever they go out of view. Hopefully that helps with site performance issues.
				</p>
				<p>
					To further improve desktop performance, there is also a new site option to disable all animations in case they make things slow or you just don't like them. Check the "No Animations" setting. If your device or browser is set to use reduced motion they will have been be disabled by default (cannot be re-enabled unless you chance that device/browser setting). Some animations are also disabled by default when browsing the mobile version of the site.
				</p>
				<p>
					Lastly there was a behind-the-scenes update to how tooltip data is embedded which may result in some performance improvement or at the very least reduces the amount of loaded HTML code.
