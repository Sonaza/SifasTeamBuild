	<h1>Welcome!</h1>
	<p>
		This site hosts automatically formatted rotation charts of the cards from <a href="https://lovelive-as-global.com/" target="_blank">Love Live SIF All Stars</a>. These charts can be useful for determining at a glance which of the girls is the most likely to receive another card next, based on how many cards are remaining in the current rotation and how long it has been since their last one.
	</p>
	<p>
		Certainly the developers are not bound to rigid rotations, a fact most evident in event card rotations but frequently seen in other categories of cards as well. So this site should be used as an aid for educated guesses, not a singular source of truth.
	</p>
	<p>
		Card and event data is retrieved from <a href="https://allstars.kirara.ca/" target="_blank">Kirara All Stars Card Database</a>. They do not guarantee full validity of the data at all times as it is automatically harvested from in game announcements, therefore a similar disclaimer applies to this site. Errors may be present but a best effort is made.
	</p>
	<p>
		Card statistics page uses the original JP release dates for calculating how long it has been since a card was added to the game.
